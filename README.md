# Profile Intensity web app

Application for scientific research of Luminol chemiluminescence enhancement via the localized surface plasmon resonance in metal nanoparticles.

The application compares the intensity of two channels (base and sample channels) and gives the result in a numerical value. 
It also creates a pdf report with all the results.

## Working process

1) Make sample and base channels.
2) Take a photo of the sample with the base channel and the sample channel.
3) Run the app and upload photo to it. 
4) Wait the result.
